### Getting Help

Don't hesitate to ask for assistance! I have help hours specifically in place because I want you to succeed, and the best place to connect with questions is one-on-one. If you can’t make it to my posted help hours, let me know and we can find another time. Other help options include:

  * Post your question to the class Teams Question-Answering channel
  * Get together with classmates to study together
  * Drop by the [Math Resource Center](https://www.up.edu/learningcommons/math-resource-center/index.html){target="_blank"}, which offers both drop-in and appointment-based tutoring.
  * Google it. If you find a resource helpful, let me know.

I understand that life happens, and illness, depression, family, relationships can disrupt our lives. When something arises, REACH OUT! I want to be able to support you in this course, and can only do so if you let me know.

## **Quick Resources**

The main textbook is [Probability, Statistics, and Data: A fresh approach using R](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~speegle/_book/){target="_blank"} by Darrin Speegle and Bryan Clair. The textbook is free and open-source. We will also use other supplementary books and resources throughout the course (please see the [Topics Schedule](topics.html)).

If not, then send a request when you log in. Let me know if you need any assistance. If you need the Teams code for this class, use **u791pua**.

<span style="color:red">Please check the class Teams regularly.</span> If you need to have Teams notifications sent to your email, please set up your email preferences within Teams.

<span style="color:red">If you prefer communicating through email, note that I had set up an email filter for this course and you must put the “MTH 202” keyword in your subject line.</span> It is easy for me to get notice of your email if you put the keyword in the subject line. Concise and specific messages are helpful so I know how I can best help you.
